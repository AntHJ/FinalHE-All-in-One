      NOTE : I did not created FinalHE, or the apps it installs (with the exception of the CloneTool)
      I extracted and recompiled them to work with the FinalHE installer

- if you are connecting your Vita using a USB connection you may need to install the included drivers,
- if you are connecting with WiFi, make sure you dont have CMA or QCMA intalled or running and make sure that you select allow on the Windows security message popup.

      You should see a > arrow on the right edge of the FinalHE window. press it to reveal additional apps
      that can be sent / install to the vita in 1 go.. file transfer can take a while so be patient.
      
      I doubt you will require ALL the apps included, but its a good mixture of useful tools
      I have added a * to the Important apps
